# `storage-js`

JS Client library to interact with Supabase Storage.

- Documentation: https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/storage-createbucket

## Quick Start Guide

### Installing the module

``` bash
npm install @supabase/storage-js
```

### Connecting to the storage backend

``` bash
# .env
SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL=https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<service_role>
```

``` js
// index.hs
import { SupabaseStorageClient } from '@supabase/storage-js'
import 'dotenv/config'

const STORAGE_URL = process.env.SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL;
const SERVICE_KEY = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY; //! service key, not anon key

const storage_client = new SupabaseStorageClient(
    STORAGE_URL,
    {
        apikey: SERVICE_KEY,
        Authorization: `Bearer ${SERVICE_KEY}`,
    }
);
```

### Handling resources

- Create a new Storage bucket

    ``` js
    const { data, error } = await storage_client.createBucket("test_bucket", { public: false });
    ```

- Retrieve the details of an existing Storage bucke

    ``` js
    const { data, error } = await storage_client.getBucket("test_bucket");
    ```

- Updates a new Storage bucket

    ``` js
    const { data, error } = await storage_client.createBucket("test_bucket", { public: true });
    ```

- Remove all objects inside a single bucket

    ``` js
    const { data, error } = await storage_client.getBucket("test_bucket");
    ```

- Deletes an existing bucket (a bucket can't be deleted with existing objects inside it):

    ``` js
    const { data, error } = await storage_client.deleteBucket("test_bucket");
    ```

- Retrieve the details of all Storage buckets within an existing product:

    ``` js
    const { data, error } = await storage_client.listBuckets();
    ```
