# `storage-js`

JS Client library to interact with Supabase Storage.

- Documentation: https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/storage-createbucket

## Quick Start Guide

### Installing the module

``` bash
npm install @supabase/storage-js
```

### Connecting to the storage backend

``` js
import { SupabaseStorageClient } from '@supabase/storage-js'

const STORAGE_URL = "https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1";
const SERVICE_KEY = "<service_role>"; //! service key, not anon key

const storageClient = new SupabaseStorageClient(
  STORAGE_URL,
  {
    apikey: SERVICE_KEY,
    Authorization: `Bearer ${SERVICE_KEY}`,
  }
);
```

### Handling resources

- Create a new Storage bucket

  ``` js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.createBucket(
    "test_bucket",    // Bucket name (must be unique)
    { public: false } // Bucket options
  );
  ```

- Retrieve the details of an existing Storage bucket

  ``` js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.getBucket("test_bucket");
  ```

- Updates a new Storage bucket

  ``` js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.updateBucket(
    "test_bucket",    // Bucket name
    { public: false } // Bucket options
  );
  ```

- Remove all objects inside a single bucket

  ``` js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.emptyBucket("test_bucket");
  ```

- Deletes an existing bucket (a bucket can't be deleted with existing objects inside it):

  ``` js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.deleteBucket("test_bucket");
  ```

- Retrieve the details of all Storage buckets within an existing product:

  ``` js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.listBuckets();
  ```
